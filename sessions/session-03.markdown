# A Little Fire

The group decided to go to [Poter's](../characters/potter.markdown) place and ask him how he knows about [Zolster](../characters/zolster.markdown) and the snake. When they got there, they noticed two [RGLs](../organizations/ridiculously-good-looking-men.markdown) standing outside the door of Poter's place. Pupi used his magic to chase them away and they did.

The group decided to sneak in through the back. Dominio unlocked the door. Kelp noticed a trap door in the floor but it was very well hidden. There were a lot of clockwork items there and they established **White-Noise** to mask their movement.

Upstairs, they found a watch counting-down, it would run out in a matter of minutes. Poter was packing in a hurry. He was very efficient in his packing, including most boxes being exactly fifty pounds plus or minus a pound. They asked him about the watch, he panicked. They decided to leave with Poter, two of the boxes that were packed first and not fifty pounds.

Pupi grabbed two boxes and headed out the front door. Kelp and Dominio had the two unusual boxes and Poter (who had fainted). As they left, exactly at the moment the watch counted down, a carriage pulled up front and eight city guard came in through the back alley.

In the resulting fight, Dominio ran up the side of the building with Poter and took pot shots with his light powers.

Kelp was attacked by the guards and fled back into the store. Trapped, she used the trap door to escape underneath the building using her box to block the entrance.

At the carriage, Pupi saw a man-like creature with a big floppy hat and large sleeves go to open the door. Pupi introduced himself with a "pull my finger". The Shadow Man stepped aside to reveal a brass octopus ridden by Zolster inside. There was a brief fight. Poter blew the Shadow Man aside. Zolster used a flamethrower against Pupi but only did minor damage.

On the roof, Dominio set the carriage horses going and Zolster was carried away. Pupi decided to follow and blew up the carriage (and set the entire block on fire).

As they were finishing up, a [woman](../characters/millie.markdown) came floating out of the fireball and headed toward Pupi. He and Dominio left, trusting Kelp would return.

# Under the Sewers

Kelp woke up in [Silt's](../characters/silt.markdown) boat. He rescued her from the sewer and gave some information. Rastin was trying to deal with the crime in the city, Rastin thought Kelp and her group were working with Zolster.

# Marvin the Merchant's Son

Marvin got **Bleeding Heart** x2 on Kelp.

The snake is a key to some lock.

Pupi decided to feed Marvin food of his people in revenge for the "black guy" comment. Marvin didn't like it.

# The Vault

The group notices that Marvin's father made multiple deliveries to the warehouse where the RGL were recruited. They noticed that there were guards protecting the warehouse next to it.

While investigating the sewer, Pupi found out that the warehouse was bricked off from the others. In the original warehouse, there was a shed in the middle. Inside, a tunnel carved out by the RGL (judging from the erotic posters on the wall) into the other warehouse. It lead to the entrance of a vault where the snake unlocked the door. There were lots of warning insides, but they went inside anyways.

It was a great big room with a small side table and a jar in the middle. As Dominio started in, teh floor began to light up in a giant anime magic circle. They went inside anyways, Kelp took the jar.

When Dominio tried to burn the snake out of the lock, it set some fires and warnings. There was explosions.

They accidently let out a giant shadow spider from the jar. And then ran away.

# Asking For Help

The group saw that the jar had a [Sisters of the Tortured Soul](../organizations/sisters-of-the-tourtured-soul.markdown) on the bottom and decided to talk to [Mother Touch](../characters/mother-touch.markdown). [Rastin](../characters/rastin.markdown) was there too. After a brief stand-off, Mother Touch gave more of the story.

The jar with the spider was temporarily in the city because of "reasons". They were trying to find a new home for it, but the party let it out before they could move it. Zolster wants it because he could use it to power some large mechanical device.

The group agreed to take the jar to its hiding place. Rastin and Millie were going to join them. Kelp decided to adopt Marvin as her son and he is now on the cruel.

Mother Touch wouldn't go because she was a pacifist.

Silt delivered Rastin, Millie, and the pitcher with the snake to the boat. Millie is in the hold, away from everyone.

# Notes

* "There is a word in my language, 'kind of a dick.'"
* Why is Silk watching Dominion, it's creepy.
